## Operator Attention: Merge-Risk-Hold Pileup

Judge-approved PRs stuck under a `loom:operator` merge-risk hold — implementation work is done, only a human merge decision is missing.

_None._

## Operator Priority

Issues the operator starred (`loom:operator-priority`); land these first.

_None._

## Ready

Human-approved issues ready for implementation (`loom:issue`).

- **#342**: signoff: move the T1 grader pin to klt 0.6.0 so the verdict of record includes item 11
- **#345**: Test entry points disagree: make check and npm test skip the signoff suite; add one make test source of truth

## In Progress

Issues currently being built (`loom:building`).

_None._

## PRs Awaiting Review

PRs waiting on Judge (`loom:review-requested`).

_None._

## Approved (Awaiting Merge)

PRs that passed review and are queued for Champion auto-merge (`loom:pr`).

_None._

## Proposed

Issues carrying `loom:curated`.

- **#321**: run_net_attribution.py's 60-deck grid has no off-host execution path, so the post-#314 re-run cannot be taken from a dispatch worker *(curated)*
- **#324**: Regenerate the deglitch dwell sweep against the star extraction: the post-layout slowest crossing moved from 20.77 to 22.34 µs *(curated)*
- **#331**: sim/harness/runner.py: batch (klt sim) execution path so control grids can run off dispatch workers (mechanism question from #321) *(curated)*

## Proposed (Architect / Hermit)

_None._
